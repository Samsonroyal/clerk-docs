# Clerk Express.js SDK

## Set up Clerk Express.js

<Steps>

### Create a Clerk application

You need to create a Clerk application in your Clerk Dashboard before you can set up Clerk Express.js. For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.

### Install `@clerk/express`

Once a Clerk application has been created, you can install and then start using Clerk Express.js in your application. An ESM module for the Clerk Express SDK is available under the [`@clerk/express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clerk/express) npm package.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
```sh filename="terminal"
npm install @clerk/express
```

```sh filename="terminal"
yarn add @clerk/express
```

```sh filename="terminal"
pnpm add @clerk/express
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment variables

Below is an example of an `.env.local` file.

**Pro tip!** If you are signed into your Clerk Dashboard, your secret key should become visible by clicking on the eye icon. Otherwise, you can find your keys in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.

<InjectKeys>

```env filename=".env.local"
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
```

</InjectKeys>

</Steps>

## Available methods

All resource operations are mounted as sub-APIs on the `clerkClient` object. To access the resource operations, [you must first instantiate a `clerkClient` instance](/docs/references/express/available-methods).

## Multi-session applications

If Clerk is running in multi-session mode, it's important to ensure your frontend sends the Session ID that is making the request.

Our middleware will look for a query string parameter named `_clerk_session_id`. If this parameter is not found, the middleware will instead choose the last active session, which may be subject to race conditions and should not be relied on for authenticating actions.

## Error handling

Express SDK functions throw errors (`ClerkAPIResponseError`) when something goes wrong. You'll need to catch them in a `try/catch` block and handle them gracefully. For example:

```ts filename="example.ts"
try {
  const res = await someBackendApiCall();
} catch (error) {
  // Error handling
}
```
